## USER STORIES

My application focuses on showcasing my ability to utilize the queue data structure algorithm. 
This application allows the user to join a queue and "adopt" either a dog or a cat. The cats and dogs are also in queues, and so the first one in is also the first one out.

## Landing Page

This introductory page allows for users to read instructions for the adoption process. 
Then they are able to enter thier name into a queue and choose a cat or a dog. 


## Adopt Page

After selecting which type of pet the user desires, and entering thier name on the previous page, the user is then added to a queue.
The user will be able to see their name in the adoption queue, as other users who were first adopt thier pets.

When the queue gets to the user they are paired with the pet that has been in the queue the longest without being adopted. 
The user is able to "adopt" said pet.

After adopting, all users are congratulated on their adoptions.
They are also able to view the next pet who was also successfully adopted. 

The user may select the home page button to then repeat the process.
